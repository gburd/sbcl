;;; Repeat calling THUNK until its cumulated runtime, measured using
;;; GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME, is larger than PRECISION. Repeat this
;;; REPETITIONS many times and return the time one call to THUNK took
;;; in seconds as a float, according to the minimum of the cumulated
;;; runtimes over the repetitions.
;;; This allows to easily measure the runtime of expressions that take
;;; much less time than one internal time unit. Also, the results are
;;; unaffected, modulo quantization effects, by changes to
;;; INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND.
;;; Taking the minimum is intended to reduce the error introduced by
;;; garbage collections occurring at unpredictable times. The inner
;;; loop doubles the number of calls to THUNK each time before again
;;; measuring the time spent, so that the time measurement overhead
;;; doesn't distort the result if calling THUNK takes very little time.
