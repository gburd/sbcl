SBCL Git Hooks

These scripts live in /home/scm_git/s/sb/sbcl/sbcl.git/hooks on
SourceForge, and have nothing to do with SBCL as such -- and
everything to do with developer convenience and maintenance.

To push updates there:

  ssh -t <sfuser>,sbcl@shell.sourceforge.net create
  scp <script> <sfuser>,sbcl@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/scm_git/s/sb/sbcl/sbcl.git/hooks/
